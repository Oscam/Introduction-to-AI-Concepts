## Neural Networks

**Neural Networks** or *artificial neural networks* is a branch of Artificial Intelligence whereby computers process data by imitating how the huma brain works.
Complex Neural networks can be termed as deep learning. 

### Applications of Neural Networks
- Used in **Computer Vision** for tasks such as: 
  - Image classification
  - facial recognition
  - autonomous driving
- Used in **Natural Language Processing** for various tasks like: 
  - Machine translation
  - chatbots
  - text generation
- Used in **Predictive Analytics** for tasks such as: 
   - Financial modeling 
   - fraud detection
   - risk management

### How it works
1. Data enters the network.
2. Each neuron calculates a weighted sum of inputs plus bias.
3. The activation function decides the neuron's output.
4. Outputs flow through the layers until the final prediction.
5. During training, the network adjusts weights and biases using backpropagation and gradient descent to minimize error.

## NLP
### NLP (Natural Language Processing)

#**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It combines concepts from linguistics, machine learning, and computer science to process text and speech data. NLP allows machines to communicate with humans in a more natural and meaningful way.

#### Why NLP is Important
- It powers **chatbots and virtual assistants**.
- It helps in **language translation** between different languages.
- It is used in **sentiment analysis** to determine emotions in text.
- It enables **speech recognition** and voice-controlled systems.
- It improves search engines by understanding user queries better.

#### Common Applications
1. Text classification (spam detection, topic labeling)
2. Machine translation (e.g., Google Translate)
3. Question-answering systems
4. Automatic text summarization
5. Voice assistants like Siri and Alexa

#### How NLP Works
NLP systems typically:
- Break text into smaller components (tokenization)
- Analyze grammar and sentence structure
- Use machine learning models to detect patterns
- Generate predictions or meaningful responses
